# intellij-object-calisthenics-analyzer
An IntelliJ plugin for analyzing your Java source code's adherence to [Object Calisthenics](http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/luontola/tdd-2009/ext/ObjectCalisthenics.pdf). 

Makes use of my [Object Calisthenics Analyzer API](https://github.com/chairbender/object-calisthenics-analyzer). Supports checking for pretty much all 9 calisthenics rules (with a few small exceptions).
